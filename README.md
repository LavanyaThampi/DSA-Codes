🧠 1. Python Programming for Data Science
- Python basics (variables, loops, functions)
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples)
- File handling
- Exception handling
- Lambda functions, list comprehensions
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)

📊 2. Data Analysis with Pandas and NumPy
- NumPy arrays and operations
- Pandas Series and DataFrames
- Data cleaning and wrangling
- Handling missing values
- Filtering, sorting, and grouping data
- Merging and joining datasets

📈 3. Data Visualization
- Matplotlib: line plots, bar charts, histograms
